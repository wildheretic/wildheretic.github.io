## Transcendentalism

Transcendentalism is not a path out of the Earth matrix. You can leave when you sleep or when you die. It is a way to transform yourself and thereby your environment. By using clairvoyant sight, you can transform your soul, energise god and therefore yourself. 

It is a way to help release your binds to your original earthly point of view and to incorporate other energies. If nothing else, you will become a better person.
