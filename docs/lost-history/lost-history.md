## Lost history

There seem to be an awful lot of false narratives out there that can luckily be dispelled by reading original source documents, maps and books if they can be found and understood. Finding out what really happened in the recorded past (early middle ages to today), and when, is obviously never 100 percent conclusive. 

Let's start with the maps of the historic period (1700 AD onwards). They tell us the earth has expanded in recent times.
