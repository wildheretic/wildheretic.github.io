## Comments (Concave Earth Theory) ##
These are all the posts written by others as well as my own replies (initially user _Totalrecall_, then changed to _Wild Heretic_) under the main Concave Earth Theory article on the old Wordpress site. There are over 800 posts, the largest number under any of the pages, all written between 2013 and 2016. I might add more comments from the other articles at a later date.

Some of my opinions to readers' comments may have also changed considerably since that time. The posts are recorded here for posterity. There will be some interesting links to other websites that are still live.
