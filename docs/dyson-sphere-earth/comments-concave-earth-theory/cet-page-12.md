Hey dude, can confirm not a troll! I’ve been experimenting with a couple of my lasers to see what I can put together in a short amount of time.  
The mineshaft is going to be tricky, but I’m sure I’ll find something 🙂

Long story short:  
I intent to attach an ultra-violet laser to a spirit level, and send a beam across Loch Ness 1 inch above the surface over a distance of 3-20 kilometers.  
At the other shore there will be a white target that will brightly fluoresce when exposed to the intense UV light.  
  
If the earth is concave, I expect the laser light to drop into the Loch, which will be visible by a green-yellow glow from the UV light hitting the dense algae and particles in the water.  
  
I will test this hopefully in late February, early march when the great glen is at it’s coldest to avoid heat rise distorting the beam.  
I will also test this with the beam at different elevations above the water for error correction and trigonometry purposes.  
  
If you have anything to add, I’m all ears! 😀

Over 20 meters we could expect to see a deviation of 7.3mm!  
That would be very hard to measure and would require very precise workmanship to ensure accuracy, but not impossible.

No, won’t work. That’s a bendy light experiment. It’s still a good experiment though to test the bend of light. Over those distances I expect light to bend up quite dramatically despite it being over water, which increases the horizon. You would then have to deduct the calculated supposed downward bend of a convex Earth away from the light bend discrepancy to see how much light bent upwards. Let’s say over 3km you found the laser to bend up by 80 inches over water. Take away the convex downward bend of say 64 inches and you come to the conclusion that the light bent upwards by 16 inches (if the earth were convex). Of course if it were concave, then the light bent upwards by 80 plus 64 inches!  
  
Light as a measure of the curvature of the crust will only work over very small distances in my opinion, like 20m, because at these distances light isn’t supposed to bend at all. Do a series of measurements.

Why do you say that?  
  
7.3mm is still fine when taking 250 measurements over 5000m. We should start to see a proper trend from the 2-3km mark.

The laser experiment proposed in my article is correct WH.  
There is no need to level the laser and you are simply aiming at the target.  
The laser is below the supposed convexity which should block the beam.  
The beam bending up doesn’t matter here. YOU can adjust it. It’s just about the physical barrier in the middle of the lake, a bulge due to the supposed convexity.

A quote and a question:  
  
The following quote is what brought me into the world of ideas (which I now see has been around since ancient times, and is currently being quite beautifully summarized and improved upon by both Steven Joseph Christopher and Wild Heretic and others)  
  
“Hitler and his mystical compatriots had a curiously inverted view of the universe. To their way of thinking, the universe consists of infinite rock which is broken by numerous hollow areas. In other words, the universe is like an infinite piece of Swiss cheese—solid with many holes in it. The concave surfaces of the hollow areas are the surfaces of ‘planets’, including Earth. Humans are therefore not living on the outer surface of a round ball: they are being pushed by gravity against the inner surface of a hollow area. According to the Nazis, the sun hangs suspended in the middle of the hollow area, the sky is made of blue gas, and the stars are tiny objects (perhaps ice crystals) which hang suspended in a similar fashion to the sun. In this infinite ‘Swiss cheese’ universe of stone there are many fissures and cracks that allow travel between the hollow areas. In an adjoining hollow area, according to Nazism, lives the race of Aryan ‘supermen.’ Hitler’s underground “supermen” were therefore true extraterrestrials, but in a curiously inverted fashion. Lest it be assumed that the Nazi Swiss cheese model of the universe was one of Hitler’s “Big Lies,” there is evidence that the Nazi leadership took the idea quite seriously. For example, an attempt was made to locate the British fleet during World War II with infrared rays pointing toward the sky. The Nazis believed that the rays would hit the opposite side of the concave Earth.” – from the book Gods of Eden, page 389  
  
So here’s the question:  
  
After realizing we are living inside a ball prison, in which space is not an escape option, and the the only possible way to enter a new world is to go through an exit hole existing at Antarctica, what is the NEXT LOGICAL ACTION?  
  
I propose the next logical action is to storm the gates.  
  
Meaning, tomorrow without requesting permission, take a totally unauthorized boat/plane/helicopter/submarine stealthy speedy trip, I’ll pay for the bribes required, perhaps starting from from Argentina, perhaps starting from elsewhere, acting at first as if heading towards some close-but-different-location, and then SUDDENLY verge towards Antarctica before the surprised military personnel can realize and act upon the realization, and before the highest ranking officer in Antarctica is able to receive the orders from the chain-of-command to kill us all…  
  
(yes, of course, a plan must already be in place to defend the exit hole with deadly force, and practice rehearsals have no doubt been made, but nobody besides Hitler has ever had the rare combination of will, courage, and desire to escape this prison, enough to actually go to that continent in an effort to leave, so the current highest ranking officer in Antarctica will probably be so shocked and surprised that a group of guerrillas have actually arrived now in the present day that he most likely will waste time going through the procedure of getting extra confirmation from above to actually send his troops to kill this escape team – because who knows, we could be beaming a live stream to the world for all he knows, so just to cover his ass the coward might waste time making phone calls, and thus folks above him might also waste time making phone calls to their higher ups, each decider being too scared to actually be the person to officially authorize the commencement of shooting this group of 10 people who might very well be armed with live video streaming capabilities, so it is very possible that we might make it to an entry hole BEFORE anybody is actually able to massacre us)  
  
This to me seems like the next logical action…  
  
(instead of merely pontificating in our armchairs until we die of natural causes) because hey, why die wondering, let’s go and find out once and for all whether we can escape down a hole before getting shot.  
  
Seriously, if we really think we are living within a ball, and that the exit hole is in Antarctica, why are we not making any attempt to go do the ULTIMATE test?  
  
Do you think that 10 folks will get wiped out too easily, and thus our goal is to get a much BIGGER group of humanity interested in storming the gates?  
  
Let’s say you manage to convince a million folks to go with you, totally revolution style, knowing full well that many will get killed but SOME will make it into the hole alive, then in THAT case would you feel brave enough to go take the action you know you need to take?  
  
Just a question I’m seriously hoping might spark a real conversation about real physical follow through of what we have discovered.  
  
If the above sounds too crazy, then please let me know, what do each of YOU think is the next logical action, for us humans alive today who have realized the ultimate truth of Earth?

Here’s my idea for an experiment using only tangibles: take a 10 km piece of strong neutrally buoyant rope https://www.machovec.com/rope/fishing.htm#Hoverline and pull it really tight over a lake. In a convex earth the rope’s middle will lie 2 meters below the lake’s surface, whereas in a concave earth the middle will be floating on the surface (or 2m above the surface were it not for gravity!).

One of proof can be shadow zone of seismography it was not mentioned by experimental evidences. One theory suggest that liquid core bends seismic waves like light refraction, other theory suggest that liquid core of earth dumping seismic waves, event on one side of earth seismographic equipment can not register any activity on other side.

Re: Concave Earth Theory  
  
Wild Heretic and most of the readers here are confident we are living inside a bubble Truman-style prison, and yet nobody here (except me) is interested in finding the exit and LEAVING?  
  
http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/#comment-7223  
  
Wow. How disappointing. This makes me think you folks don’t really believe what you are talking about.  
  
Is this all just some nihilistic goalless mental-masturbation mere discussion, in which we talk and talk and talk about mentally finding the truth but don’t actually have any interest in PHYSICALLY walking to through the exit and seeing what is waiting outside this ball?  
  
Concave Earthers: Talking the talk, but not interested in walking the walk. Since AD 110.  
  
Well, fine, if you are scared to go through the exit door, then at least please share what you each think is beyond the exit door.  
  
Do you agree with the theory accepted by Hitler, which is that surrounding this ball is infinite rock?  
  
In that case, it is the mass of the infinite rock totally surrounding this ball which causes everything inside our ball to be pulled towards the outside.  
  
If you think this ball is NOT surrounded by rock, then what do you personally imagine is on the outside?  
  
http://www.panoramio.com/photo/34803941  
  
And either way, whether you think our ball is encased in rock (with tunnels leading to other balls), or whether you think our ball is NOT encased in rock (simply sitting there, surrounded by air, like in the Vatican sculpture), either way, DO YOU THINK THAT LEAVING THIS BALL WOULD LEAD TO MEETING OTHER BEINGS?  
  
Is this the real reason everyone seems too afraid to go through the exit, a fear of meeting beings on the other side?  
  
Me personally, I simply don’t want to get painfully shot by the military humans guarding the north and south poles.  
  
Let me put it this way, if there WEREN’T military thugs preventing us from going through the exit… WOULD you have the courage to go through through the exit?  
  
If your hones answer is “No” – meaning you would not want to go through the exit to leave this ball, even if the door were wide open and unguarded – then please share why.  
  
Why DON’T you want to “emancipate yourself from physical slavery” (the physical slavery of 90% of our daily energy expenditure being stolen by the richest humans in this ball) – “none but ourselves can free our bodies” (the only way to escape this physical slavery system is to leave the ball.)  
  
Obviously, I definitely want to venture outside and see what is outside this ball. Why don’t you? 🙂

This earth was made for us. I love it here, wonderful and big enough. I don’t want to leave (family and friends) those I love so soon and those who love me. There is still so much to discover here, specially now if we really are in a concave earth (just last year I still was sure it was convex). I agree with WH, we will have much time to exit when we are dead anyway. No hurry. 🙂

In reply to Wild Heretic.  
Sounds easy. But I wonder, since the governments have so many military bases at the south pole, we are we assuming that they would leave an exit the north unguarded?  
  
I’m kind of thinking the only way out is where they have all the guards posted.  
  
But I would love to be wrong about this. So, why IS the north pole relatively lacking in military bases, while the south pole has so many?  
  
   
2015/01/15 at 9:27 pm  
    Wild Heretic  
In reply to Observer.  
Maybe because the south pole is land and the north pole is water. Or maybe the military bases are there for a different reason?

Great video, one consideration on the laser experiment. Keep in mind that the dummy level experiment demonstrated how light can curve up to 16 cm per 500 meters depending on conditions and the time of day. If the laser curves up it would complicate the experiment. When someone does it they may want to try it at different times of the day and at night. At midnight the light did not curve much in the dummy level experiment. I would like to try this experiment at Lake Tahoe one day, it is 11 miles long if I remember correctly and if there is no wind is flat at night. I live in Costa Rica and we do not have any really large lakes, I may have to go to Nicaragua and try it out on that lake that is one of the largest in the world, I do not know if the waves are flat at night. Great stuff. It would be cool to get one of those military infra red telescopes.

It sounds like a great adventure but if the powers that have unlimited funds do not want you to go there I would think the chances of making it there alive are close to zero. It would be like trying to get in to area 51 to watch the filming of the Apollo moon landings, ha ha. If anyone does go please take lots of pictures and videos. The best thing to do is share this information with the world until it can no longer be denied, thanks to all of you who have put in so much effort and are sharing it.

All Reality is happening in My/Your/Our Mind.  
All is consciousness and in a way this life/reality We (there is NOT even a we) live is but a dream and all in it that has form is fleeting.  
When you finally realise that you cannot hold on to anything because there is simply NOTHING to hold on to , you are truly FREE.  
Looking for a “way out” within a Dream is still inside the Dreamers(You’re/Gods consciousness) Mind and therefore an illusion.  
In the beginning (explosion of the”God Head/Subconsciousness) I/We told Ourselves to get LOST , and so we did.  
We create on the go “as within so without”.  
There is no good nor evil cause all experience will expand the “Godhead” consciousness that is I/We.  
Some parts of Me/Us perceive only the surface and are truly “lost” cuz they truly seem to forgot who they are.  
It’s better to discard all I/We have just said cuz it sure ain't no fun in being All Together ALONE.  
So go OUT AND EXPLORE …  
  
….and get LOST (again)

In reply to Nils Esche.  
How beautiful it is to gain one more piece of the puzzle and watch the other pieces fall into place. Proper biblical translation is so important, one word “in” or “on” changes perspective and sheds more light on this illusion that is being presented to us. We are in the earth with the fallen angels who are aspects of God with ego, which we share in common with them, the ego that is afraid, angry, jealous, frustrated, and above all that deep down feels abandoned by God. The anger we all have is just a defense mechanism to protect the perceived danger of facing the overwhelming fear of rejection. God does not judge Lucifer or the fallen angels, they are a part of him/her. God loves us and Lucifer who have been placed in this concave earth together. Was not Lucifer Gods favorite angel at one time. We have not been placed here as a punishment but rather as a place to heal this pain, this fear, this ego. Just like in the Wizard of OZ at the end when the good witch said, “you have always had the power to go home”, we also have this power, however to decide to go home you have to be aware of the choice and how it works. For example on the micro level take an aggressor victim relationship, the victim cannot get out of it until she or he sees what the situation is and admits the problem. Lucifer who is still apparently very angry with God does not want us to realize we have this choice therefor he has created this illusory matrix to confuse the issue, he has turned everything inside out so to speak and on so many levels as most of the concave earth people are aware of, the “Great work” mystery Babylon, the great scam. As long as we are not able to see the situation we are in we can not chose to leave it behind. In the same way you can love a family member that is a serious drug addict it does not help them if you act as an enabler. That is what God is doing with us, the love has never left but the addiction to suffering, causing and receiving it must be done in maybe in a quarantine concave earth, so that we wont hurt others who don't have this type of ego,the ego of suffering. Why trick us into believing we are living “on” the earth? So you wont understand the situation, you cannot chose if you don’t know what the choices are. We sheeple are unaware of the reality and therefor easily manipulated into making the wrong choices over and over again. We are living in the world of false ego, with are good buddy Lucifer who we have unconsciously chosen to hang out with, he seems to like our company and doesn’t want us to leave so he tricks us on every level imaginable, inverting the universe is genius really. The truth will set you free. Then how do we choose on the deepest of levels to let the ego drift away revealing who you truly are and always have been? You first admit it is there and then you observe it without judgement which frees you from identifying with it, which frees you from being a slave to it, a victim. For example when you get frustrated in a traffic jam because you are late for an important meeting you simply observe the frustration seeing that it is not you and that it is not helping your situation anyway. It will not help you to think clearly, it will not make the traffic jam start to move so you begin to ask yourself why am I causing myself “extra” suffering. Any of you who have experienced this type of “watching” knows that you experience peace and a sense of freedom that was covered over when identifying with the suffering. You may still have to face the consequences of not getting to the meeting on time but that is a different issue that can be confronted in the moment and with in a state of non suffering your actions and decisions will usually be much better anyway. I highly recommend Eckhart Tolle to see more clearly how this ego works in your life. Some of you may judge him because he has been promoted by people like Oprah, but don’t judge associations, God works in mysterious ways, if you are going to be critical of something, criticize the concept not the man or who you judge him to be. I am not a “religious person” but I do love God and want to work out my ego with him/her. I do not believe that the plural God of the old testament, the Elohim were Gods, the original translations talk more about beings of flesh and blood that ruled over us, in a sometime very cruel and uncaring way, I don’t believe God is a slave master, to be feared. I know God loves all of us unconditionally, no matter what. The Elohim on the other hand maybe should be feared if they have the power to effect this concave world we are in. In the end there is nothing to fear, death of the body is not the end and is not a judgment against you and it will happen to all of us, some sooner than later. God bless everyone and thanks for revealing this great truth about the Earth.

WH, Bob makes a good point. People like William Copper were aloud to say anything they wanted until they reached a certain point, like predicting 911. The concave earth cover up is way way way bigger than 911, it is the big daddy of them all I would guess. Right now not enough people take this site or any of the other teachers and researchers of the topic seriously, therefor they are safe. I am sure you have thought about this, take care of yourself.

It would be an interesting experiment to have a race between two planes at different altitudes, one directly above the other. In a concave earth the plane at the higher altitude, if flying at the same speed, should win. Does anyone know if altitude effects flight time? In a convex earth it should take longer the higher you fly. Wind at different altitudes could also mess up the experiment. The race would start once they were nose to nose at their different altitudes and end also in the air.

An interesting note regarding the Jesuits. I saw a video that claimed the Jesuits use Astrology to time stock market manipulations, That is why astrology has been demonized as nothing more than pseudo science. I think JP Morgan also once said millionaires don’t use astrology, billionaires do. This caught my attention because my uncle developed a system to trade commodities using astrology and he turned about $100,000 into over 3 million in less than two years. This was 25 years ago, he used to meditate inside a rotating copper pyramid using a system of mirrors so as not to throw up, very interesting guy. He would have loved the concave earth theory if he was around today. He had a private plane, that burst into flames mid flight, he believed the government was watching him, maybe they killed him. He was not famous, but maybe figuring out how to beat the stock market with astrology, if you actually start making lots of money is a no no. I think that is why “the controllers” always seem to time there actions based on very specific dates. If you want 911 to be the most effective you do it on a date where the astrological influence amplifies the fear of the event. That is how you make money in the stock market as well, the market tends to go down on a day of more fear and goes up on a day when the vibration is more aligned with confidence, if you know how to read the constellations to do this you make money. The big boys know this and use it but it only work if the masses don’t use it, otherwise it would balance out. When the bankers want to crash the market they do it on specific dates to help them. In a convex universe it is easier to hide the power of true astrology, more people will investigate astrological secrets when they understand the concave paradigm. Yes, I found it here is the link and one more reason why “they” don’t want us to know, information is power.

On a metaphysical note Terrence McKenna Decribes the DMT Trip which sounds like this drug may be taking you into the octahedral at the center of the concave earth. Many people describe a similar experience as if they are going to a real place, I don’t know if anyone one understanding the concave model has tried it but if you cant go physically this may be a good alternative. The trip only lasts about 20 minutes if you smoke it pure, you need enough of it to “break through”. I have not tried it but am going to if I can get some. I have not found anything to suggest that there are dangerous side effects, DMT is produced naturally in the brain. Sadly Terrence McKenna died of cancer, similar to Lloyde Pye. Here is a link to a Terrence Mckenna video.

Very interesting. Your uncle sounds quite a guy. Did he put the pyramid on a rotating platform and sit on the platform with him and the pyramid rotating in sync? Or did he sit down on the ground stationary and have the pyramid rotate around him? Clockwise or anticlockwise? (I assume clockwise).  
  
After meeting an expert in astrology one time, I too am convinced that there is most definitely something there. My sister got a reading once by a professional one and it was incredibly accurate for her. How that would work with the stock market, well I don’t know. 🙂

He would sit on a wooden disk with a pillow and rotate with the pyramid, there would be a mirror attached to the pyramid that you would stare into so you wouldn’t get dizzy, it took some practice. He also would meditate holding metal bars with electricity running through them at a certain frequency or pulse accompanied by music that was tuned to the true C. He had some cool meditation ideas. I cant remember if the pyramid spun clockwise or not but he was trying to balance out the energy in some way. He would also do experiments with anti gravity technology, I think he was on the right track but never got his machine off the ground.  
  
It took him over ten years to figure out the stock market and sadly all his work was stolen out of his house on the day he died. He showed me how it worked, I think the big players were the sun, moon and Jupiter. If the charts indicated a strong fear day then you short the market, like the Dow Jones, if the energy encouraged confidence you would buy. It has to do with reading the energy cycles, it is not easy to figure out without spending many years on it and the Jesuits are not likely to teach up anytime soon. I was only 20 years old at the time and should have taken it more seriously but I was in to my own thing back then. He was a great uncle, got me into meditation and thinking about all sorts of wild things when I was about 10 years old. He is probably the reason it is easy for me to understand and believe in the concave earth theory, this world is full of mysteries and you are uncovering a whooper. Keep up your great research I love telling people that they live inside the earth and then trying to prove it. I can only do that with your help and the other great researchers, like Steven and everyone else. God bless, who or what ever God is.  
  
One question, I want to do a laser test across the lake of Nicaragua, is it a waste of time with the bending light, any suggestions?

I would only do a long range light test if I were testing the bend of the light, not the Earth. Very short range, like a few meters should be fine.  
  
On a flat Earth, the ground (water) should not fall or rise, but remain the same height away from you. On a convex Earth, the ground (water) should fall away from your feet (8 inches first mile, 64 inches second mile). In a concave Earth, the ground (water) should rise up as you walk in a straight line away from your feet (8 inches first mile, 64 inches second mile). With my understanding, there is no dip or bump in the middle of a designated flat range of water or ground in either a concave or convex Earth. It should start to fall away or rise up immediately, obeying the square law.

The point I think we are all trying to make is that we have been fed a Lie.  
The fact that the Earth is motionless is supported by page after page of Science Fact, whereas a Silly Spinning Ball Earth is only supported by Science Theory.  
  
I believe we live on a Flat motionless earth, I have entertained the idea of the Concave Earth, but when looking at the horizon of the Sea it is perfectly flat and distant objects are not leaning towards us or away from us as a Concave or Convex Earth would produce.  
  
Our Vision is limited to a factor that many do not consider, the near or distance horizon must always remain at our eye level, were it to appear low or high to our eye level very numerous mundane things we take for granted would be extremely difficult. It would be a strange form of vertigo. Also our vision has certain limits and we are constrained to a certain amount of miles.  
  
One Constant is that the Earth is motionless and the Center of the Celestial Sphere, a Globe or Ball Earth is easily disproved, the Jury might still be out on the concave or flat Earth, the Concave Earth is something I have not researched as much as the motionless Earth. I have discovered facts that are easily produced that prove a motionless earth, I tend to put things in as much laymen terms as I can to get people to wake up and listen.  
  
The whole silly spinning ball Earth is the Father of Evolution and is also a key element in the coming Great Deception. We are trying to get people to wake up to save their Souls.

I really like your idea, it would disprove a Convex earth, Gravity is an artificial silly construct to try to prove the Ball earth, if the rope were to lift from the middle before snapping that would prove a concave earth, to remain on the surface would have the proof a little more in favor of a Flat Earth, at varying distances from the pulling points were it to raise from the water then that would raise the idea of a concave earth.

The camera is stationary though, isn’t it? But that doesn’t answer the old belief as to why a hovering camera moves with the Earth in tandem.

Thanks. A slightly less practical but better experiment is to have each endpoint 2m below the water’s surface. Then the midpoint would be 4m below surface in a convex earth, 2m below in a flat, and 0m below in a concave.

I’m not sure about this “dip in the middle” theory at all. Surely the earth whether water or ground will rise immediately up or down due to convexity/concavity per the square law.

In long bridges (more than 10km) the engineers could have measured the concavity/convexity easily. I guess…

It doesn’t matter that laser beam bends up here. On a convex Earth with light bending up and a bulge in the middle of the lake you wouldn’t hit the target anyway.  
You don’t level the laser in this experiment, you simply aim to hit the target. If you do, when the laser is much below the calculable convexity – the lake is concave.  
If it was convex the beam would hit the water in the middle of the lake.

11 miles is a pretty huge distance. Do you have a strong enough laser for that ?

Try sth like that 🙂 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EgobyiimKE  
People start to check things. This will be the year of the experiments 🙂
