In reply to Wild Heretic.  
Thank you for your reply.  
  
The reason why the horizon always being at eye level is more indicative of a concave Earth rather than a flat one is that when we look straight ahead we are looking at a line parallel to the ground (with official straight light rays of course). If the ground were also parallel (i.e. flat), then we would never be able to see the ground unless we looked down, but the horizon is always at eye level. It moves up to our eyes. We would always see sky in front of us and the ground below the center of our vision if the Earth were flat.  
That is not true. When you’re on a plane and look straight you don’t see land/ground at eye level. I have tested this myself. You see clouds in the distance which are indeed more or less at eye level(remember clouds can be formed even up to 13 km in some cases), but you don’t see the ground. I don’t see how this is evidence of anything related to concave Earth. It actually seems to fit the flat Earth model again, and it is explained through perspective. Of course, when you’re higher you would see more and the clouds will be at your eyes level in the far distance, the land will be visible up to a certain limit as the air prevents you to see infinitely. From an airplane i.e. from 11 km altitude you never see ground at eye level when you look straight. Please check this yourself.  
  
Karol’s optical zoom experiments are clever but absurd and his conclusions are totally misleading. Again go test this yourself. He first takes a picture/video with no zoom ~20mm focal length (the human eyes equivalent would be around 50 mm) then does the same with some zoom, compares and claims that objects which were not visible at all suddenly appeared because optical zoom lets us see farther beyond the actual horizon at that moment. Wrong. If no zoom is used you see less than what you see with the naked eye. This is true for any camera. Things appear smaller and farther away unless you use approximately 2x-3x optical zoom. Then it pretty much matches the naked eye vision. So, no, optical zoom doesn’t make the invisible visible. It just increases optically the size of what is there, but hardly distinguishable. The Horizon doesn’t rise, you just see more clearly what is already there at that particular moment if the atmospheric conditions allow it. Actually the so-called horizon changes. Sometimes you see objects which are very far away even with the naked eye, but on other occasions even with a telescope you won’t see farther than 20 km.  
  
As for Wilhelm Martin’s experiments, I don’t believe his findings indicate concave Earth. I will look into it more closely.

You don’t know if the airplane is level or the convex window has an effect or if you are really looking level – http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=airplane+window. The clouds are the horizon. Here the horizon is too high probably because his camera is tilting down a bit – http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE_USPTmYXM  
None of this is scientific.  
  
You need to test this by going to different altitudes (a tall building will do as the building is level) and use a device which will “see” level and see where the horizon is over water. That is the scientific way of doing it which Rowbotham did do.  
  
Fair enough about Karol. The horizon may always be really in the center as Rowbotham said it is.  
  
As for Wilhelm Martin, they do. If you have any questions just ask, as I have had a proper look at it in preparation for a translation for my next article. It is really excellent.

Hi, WC. Does you concave Earth theory tie into the Genesis creation account? as in the firmament is the sky, conceived as a solid dome. According to Genesis, God created the firmament to separate the “waters above” the earth from those below  
Interesting that Revelation 15 talks about a sea of glass.

I had to get to the end of the video to find out what arguments he had for a convex earth… and it was amateur balloon videos show a convex earth. Except they don’t. I obviously didn’t hit home on that front. I’ll have to expand the CET article after the next one. Balloon videos aren’t scientific. We don’t know the level of the camera and the balloon is spinning round and going up and down all over the place. In some videos the horizon is concave when pointing up, then convex if pointing down and occasionally straight for a few seconds.  
  
To demonstrate a possible curve of the horizon we would have to go to an altitude where we could be sure we were level and use something like a clinometer to make sure we were looking level and then see if there is any curve on the horizon.  
  
Here is a classic example of a balloon video which is all over the place:  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4xNcF6T7Is  
  
My favourite part is at 1:43 – http://www.wildheretic.com/?attachment_id=4363  
So if I lower my head and tilt it to the side, will i see a concave horizon? 🙂  
  
This is proof positive that none of this evidence is submittable in court. Only experiments are.  
  
We have an experiment that proves the earth is concave. We have experiments which prove the Earth doesn’t move. We have an experiment which proves that light bends upwards.  
  
It’s that simple.

Planes use Schuler tuning  
Read it’s applications. besides there is many proofs earth is concave. the flat earthers and convex people refuse to acknowledge it is over their heads. Literally :P﻿  
  
WH. is Schuler tuning and it’s applications a worthy subject to include ?

Is this the “how do planes fly level with a curved earth” question?  
  
“You have to explain planes in a concave or convex earth…??? not gravity or gps or gyroscopes keeping them level with a flat surface….”  
  
Spot the assumption lol 🙂  
  
How does he know the surface is flat? A bit of a presumption to make. Has he conducted experiments to determine if the surface is flat? Teed has, and found that it wasn’t. Flat earthers can’t get over the “The earth looks flat when I look at it” mentality and will do anything and everything to defend that perception which experimentation has now found to be false. It’s their issue not ours.  
  
Well. I remember reading a while back that planes can use either air pressure or radar I think to determine altitude. On a side note I was told that a fighter jet of British aerospace crashed into the sea killing the pilot after a new “radar” altitude system was installed which failed to recognize the density of the water and thought the seabed was the ground.  
  
Anyway, Without researching it, I would imagine the autopilot continuously beams and receives radar or reads air pressure and adjusts the plane accordingly.  
  
After researching it, it appears gyroscopes are the answer. http://flighttraining.aopa.org/students/crosscountry/special/autopilot.html  
  
There’s nothing wrong with that at all.  
  
His mistake was presuming the ground was flat. Experiments… always experiments. It’s the closest thing we have to the truth. It’s also known by another word – science.

In reply to Wild Heretic.  
Obviously, Cyrus Teed’s experiment couldn’t prove the Earth was concave. I am not saying it isn’t, it just cannot be proven by measuring the inclination through the method he used. After all, the Earth’s diameter is over 12,700 km! Who cares if in certain parts it turns out to be concave, convex or flat? It doesn’t prove a thing. Seriously, think about it. Same thing goes for airplane observations, airplanes fly at around 10-11 km altitude, again this is nothing compared with 12,700 km. Most definitely an observation made from such an altitude cannot be used to determine the shape of the planet. So, flat earthers are totally wrong when they use such data to prove their idea. But concavers are wrong too when pointing out that the horizon at eye level proves concave Earth.  
  
WH, here is an issue for you to consider. If the Earth were concave you could literally cut the distance traveled to a particular destination by flying few degrees upward. Basically, if the distance from A to B is 1000 km when measured directly above the surface (to avoid some terrain obstacles) then by flying at a constant slight upward angle, for example ~ 1 degree can actually shorten the distance to 900 km. My math is not precise, just presenting the idea roughly. Has this or anything similar been observed in aviation?

In reply to Saros.  
Teed did demonstrate that the earth inclined upwards at the exact same rate and inclination as it would if the earth were concave. Combined with other evidence of lichtkrumm and sun meridians, the evidence of a concave Earth is extremely near 100%.  
  
There was some talk of that wasn’t there with these “space” planes going high up and down to go to a place quicker. Probably just talk though. The fuel efficiency and strain on the commercial jet airline doing something like this would probably give a gross negative return in terms of cost and strain.

In reply to Wild Heretic.  
I don’t think he did, at least not convincingly.  
  
About the planes, if a plane simply flies few degrees upward it would eventually hit the ground somewhere on the concave Earth surface. If Concave Earth is inverted Convex Earth then 1 degree is 111 km higher. Hence, if the Earth were concave, I don’t see why the planes would need to first go to an altitude of 10 km and then decrease their altitude the way they do in order to land. They could just fly a bit upward in any direction and would reach the planned destination. On top of that it is definitely very inefficient in terms of fuel to follow the surface instead of flying directly given the planet is concave. Here we’re not talking about escape velocity or going into space, just mere 1 or 2 degrees upward.

In reply to Saros.  
I think Saros we are confusing what is up and down at this point. I define level as that which is level with the center of gravity in the middle of Earth space.  
  
Your flat earth level would always be pointing downwards in a concave Earth meaning that a plane would be turning its nose to the ground at an increased rate if it were flying “flat earth” level.  
  
Would it be best for a plane to travel up to 10km and back down again and then up to 10km then back down again in a “wave” formation or just fly “level” at 10km? Don’t know. Ask the airlines why they don’t go up and down. My sneaking suspicions without researching it is that it isn’t very efficient to do such maneuvers unless you are a bomber pilot trying to avoid enemy fire that is 😉

I think you’re intentionally changing the subject and pretending you don’t understand the issue. What you replied has no reference whatsoever to what I asked.  
It is absolutely logical if the Earth were concave to be able to fly directly to a destination without having to follow the surface. This is simple geometry. You can define level as you wish but the fact remains that if the Earth were concave the airlines wouldn’t waste time and fuel to follow the surface instead of taking the shortcut. Apparently all the evidence which can be easily verified points to a convex Earth. The Concave Earth is unrealistic because it would also require physical holes at the poles to get rid of the extra energy and a bunch of other stuff which has never been verified.

You would keep having to tilt the plane up to compensate for the curve of the earth so it is still flying up and not down. Concorde could fly at 60,000 feet but even that would not really be high enough to gain much of a shortcut even assuming it was a shortcut and not a curve flight following the contour of the curve. In normal horizontal flight in either a convex or concave model at a steady 60,000 feet it would just follow the contour of the curve but it’s instruments would tell it it was horizontal at all times.

In reply to Saros.  
We have no idea what is going on at the poles. There may be physical holes or there may not be. I am going for a “yes” on that front.  
  
There is no shortcut. You have to go higher than 10km to shortcut. They can’t go that high. I’m sure they would love to but they aren’t built for that. They hit their maximum cruising altitude and that is it. The only other way is down. Tell me how they shortcut after they reach their highest cruising altitude? I’m sure they would love to cruise at 100km and really shortcut, but alas they cannot.  
  
And yes, “level” is intrinsic to the question.  
  
  
All the evidence that can be easily verified points to a convex Earth.  
So flat earth out the window now and convex it is. Bullet point this evidence and let’s discuss it.

“why do you think there is outside?” If the theory is correct then nothing, not even time or space as that would be a “something”  
Hollywood and TV have bombarded us with Aliens and Space travel and try to make out we are just a small speck in very large Universe. Satanic deception is everywhere. As i believe in the creator of life and matter, it’s not too much of a problem for me if creation is 8000 miles in diameter of 50 trillion light years. Evolution is BS as are most of the superstitions of so called science and have pagan/occult/satanic roots.

Something to think about: When there is a sky with lots of clouds, but some “holes” in them, you get to see those beautiful sun ray images, just like e.g. http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/218/3/d/Sun_Rays_by_RayOfLight1005.jpg  
  
My question is this: If the sun was 150 mio. miles away, shouldn’t these “sunrays” we see be (almost exactly) parallel? Yet, they form a pretty wide angle, which would indicate the position of the sun being a whole lot nearer than this gigantic distance.  
  
Furthermore, if you look at these rays, they seem to widen up towards the earth’s surface. How is that possible if the sun was more than a milion times farther away than the distance between clouds and surface??

Apparently, you have assumed wrongly that I believe in flat Earth. No, I don’t. I was talking about flat Earth only to give you an example of how what you prove here can also be used by someone to prove flat Earth, not that I believe in either one. Most of the arguments overlap anyway.  
  
Regarding the cruising altitude, I understand what you mean, but I think you haven’t considered all scenarios. Yes, you need to go higher than 10 km if you want to go to Australia directly from England. But if you just want to cut the distance between two cities located 100 km apart, you don’t need to go higher than 10 km at all. Do you see what I mean?  
  
I am not a shill. I was even thinking at one point that you were playing a prank on all of us, because you seem to pretend to not understand the problems with the concave Earth model and are willing to accept it pretty much on faith. At the same time repeating that it is all about experiments and science.  
  
I never said I believe in flat Earth, concave Earth or whatever. I was simply discussing their probability. As for what is more plausible and well evidenced I would say convex Earth still remains the best explained model. It is not surprising that pretty much everyone thinks it is true. Don’t underestimate people’s intelligence.

Then why didn’t you say so? You defended flat earth to the end and then suddenly flip over.Very odd and deceitful. And no; the arguments on this blog that dismiss the helio and convex scenario leave other options open such as flat earth. However, later in the blog they quickly narrow down to the concave scenario. The next article will eliminate all other scenarios for good. I have presented all the evidence in these comments to you of a concave not flat earth, not geocentric, not heliocentric. Don’t worry they will be laid out properly in the next article and 4 of the previous ones will be greatly reinforced.  
  
But if you just want to cut the distance between two cities located 100 km apart, you don’t need to go higher than 10 km at all. Do you see what I mean?  
  
Correct. Helicopters don’t go that high. Neither do cars. Helicopters still have to ascend and descend though. What is the problem? Which will reach their destination faster? A helicopter that ascends to 1000 feet travels 1000 feet level with the ground and descends 1000 feet to its destination; or a helicopter than ascends 1000 feet and travels at a slowly declining angle to its destination. The latter of course whether the earth is flat or concave. In the concave scenario he will reach his destination a tad sooner than than the flat earth model and a bit more sooner still than the convex one. Are you suggesting an experiment Saros? Interesting.  
  
I am not a shill.  
Forgive me if I don’t take your word on that. You certainly have an agenda. Which model are you going to support next? The standard geocentric one? and after that, what is the next model you will flip to? 🙂 Stop yanking my chain.  
  
I was even thinking at one point that you were playing a prank on all of us, because you seem to pretend to not understand the problems with the concave Earth model and are willing to accept it pretty much on faith. At the same time repeating that it is all about experiments and science.  
“all of us” – who is that? You can’t speak for anyone else but yourself, unless you mean the people you represent.  
What are the problems of a concave earth? You can’t state something as fact without backing it up with evidence. Bullet point the problems and let’s discuss them. I’ve explained the science and my reasoning. You have yet to do yours. Show me the science behind a convex earth and we will discuss it.  
  
As for what is more plausible and well evidenced I would say convex Earth still remains the best explained model. It is not surprising that pretty much everyone thinks it is true.  
Thank you for your opinion. Now here is mine: Everyone is full of untested assumptions. The world is full of them. My assumptions are less these days thanks to critical thinking but I am still guilty of it. Everyone thinks it is true because they have been told it is true. They didn’t test what they have been told.  
  
Don’t underestimate people’s intelligence.  
I underestimate people’s lack of time and inclination to test what they have been told.

In reply to Wild Heretic.  
Fair enough. However, it is not critical thinking to assume the whole world has conspired against you. This is the definition of paranoia.  
  
By the way, you just avoided the issue with the distance once again. You can cut the distance between two points on a concave surface without the need to fly above 10 km! This is completely clear to me. When they measure the distance between cities by air, I don’t think it turns out the Earth’s has a smaller diameter. Therefore, concave surface doesn’t explain it.  
  
In my opinion, the conclusions you have made are premature. Basically, you just lay out some evidence which is not even absolute or widely accepted and then jump to conclusions as if it is completely clear to anyone. I am sure many don’t understand you at all and disregard the whole thing as a big joke. You just asked me, for instance ‘to show you the science behind a convex earth”. How is this critical thinking? There are thousands of books on that subject. It is obvious to me at least, that the science behind concave Earth is very weak, same with flat Earth. They are both interesting ideas, but imaginary and based on pseudoscience. They definitely make you think and question stuff, but it is not healthy to go too far as obviously at one point you might think it is alright to deny the existence of everything, deny science, call it all a big hoax and believe you’re the only human who understands the world. The rest must be shills. Obviously. This is the reason why the model is not widely accepted and not some sort of conspiracy against the truth. I might be wrong, this is just an opinion.

1. Not the whole world. Only a small group of people are involved. Conspiracy is proven with the laughable NASA bubbles etc. Once NASA are caught with their pants down then all bets are off. If you want to side with consensus which requires fraud to convince you then that is your decision, but I side with the experiments.  
  
2. Now I get you. They don’t measure ground distance by plane. 🙂 If they did, then on a convex Earth the distance would be further than measured on the ground, and on a concave one it would be shorter. So the distance between 2 cities is 100km on the ground. On a convex Earth it would measure 110km and on a concave one 90km, for example, depending on height, but the ground measurement would be the same convex or concave. Now an interesting research topic would be this: Are there accurate distance readings by boat over sea between one continent and the next? If so, then comparing flight times and speed between these two points would give us an indication whether the Earth is concave or convex or flat. Unfortunately, the readings may be too fine to notice, but maybe not. A while ago, I had a good look on the net for boat readings but couldn’t find any.  
  
Funnily enough, Rowbotham described something similar with the telegraph cable readings which were indicative of a concave Earth.  
  
The bed of the Atlantic Ocean, from Valencia (western coast of Ireland) to Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, as surveyed for the laying of the cable, is another illustration or proof that the surface of the great waters of the earth is horizontal, and not convex, as will be seen by the following diagram, contracted from the section, published October 8, 1869, by the Admiralty. C, D, is the horizontal datum line, and A, B, the surface of the water, for a distance of 1665 nautical, or 1942 statute miles. At about one-third the distance from A, Newfoundland, the greatest depth is found–2424 fathoms; the next deepest part is 2400 fathoms; at about two-thirds the distance from A, towards B, Ireland, while in the centre, the depth is less than 1600 fathoms; whereas, if the water of the Atlantic is convex, the centre would stand 628,560 feet, or nearly 120 miles, higher than the two stations, Trinity Bay and Valencia; and the greatest depth would be in the centre of the Atlantic Ocean, where it would be 106,310 fathoms, instead of 1550 fathoms, which it is proved to be by actual soundings. Fig. 41 shows the arc of water which would exist, in relation to the horizontal datum line, between Ireland and Newfoundland, if the earth is a globe. Again, if the water in the Atlantic Ocean is convex–a part of a great sphere of 25,000 miles circumference–the horizontal datum line would be a chord to the great arc of water above it; and the distance across the bed of the Atlantic would therefore be considerably less than the distance over the surface. The length of the cable which was laid in 1866, notwithstanding the known irregularities of the bed of the Ocean, would be less than the distance sailed by the paying-out vessel, the “Great Eastern;” whereas, according to the published report, the distance run by the steamer was 1665 miles, while the length of cable payed out was 1852 miles.  
  
It is important to bear in mind that all the foregoing remarks and calculations are made in connection with the fact that the datum line, to which all elevations and depressions are referred, is horizontal, and not an arc of a circle. For many years past, all the great surveys have been made on this principle; but that no doubt may exist in the mind of the reader, the following extract is given from the Standing Orders of the Houses of Lords and Commons on Railway Operations, for the Session of 1862.

3. All opinion Saros and no evidence as usual. If you have no evidence to discuss except “1000s of books” then we are done here. Surely there must be some evidence in those “1000s of books” 🙂 Bullet point the evidence for a convex Earth. It’s that simple. Why haven’t you? Do you want me to do it for you? I have 4 pieces which not only are extraordinarily weak but one of which points towards a concave Earth, one is disproven, and another 2 invalid.  
  
Last chance Saros. Don’t blurt back tomorrow morning when you are in the office with any old shite about “paranoid”, “conspiracy”, “1000s of books” etc. Take you time. Spend a week, a month, even a year and come back to me with evidence for a convex Earth. If you don’t come back to me with evidence to discuss I will not approve your comment.  
  
Also I am wondering, if you find my website so interesting why do you only reply within London office hours and within an hour of my own comment being posted? No other poster is so keen on my site during the day and ignores me after work. I’ve also never met/read about/seen/heard a flat earther who after battling to the end did a 180 degree turnabout and was a convexer after all.  
  
Evidence or no comment. I leave that challenge up to you my dear shill.

I guess this is also fake: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutan_Voyager  
  
The aircraft flew westerly 26,366 statute miles (42,432 km; the FAI accredited distance is 40,212 km)[1] at an average altitude of 11,000 feet (3,350 m).  
  
If the Earth were concave it would have flown less than 40,075 km, as this is the Earth’s circumference and it would have been flying inside the sphere. Hence, the circumference would have been smaller. However, the distance traveled was bigger which once again confirms convexity.

And its flight path was…  
  
Edwards Air force base is in the northern hemisphere (California). It didn’t fly from a point on the equator around the Earth in an exact straight line and constant altitude and land back at the same point on the equator. The equator is the Earth’s circumference not California.  
  
“If” the aircraft flew in a roughly straight line at constant 3km altitude from 34.9 degrees N latitude and flew 42,434km then a convex or concave Earth is much, much bigger than they say it is which is an interesting tidbit in itself.  
  
The only way to get reliable data is to get physical readings over sea from point to point going straight and then compare it with those readings either significantly above or below and see whether the earth appears to be flat, convex or concave. Even then, those readings would only be indicative. An experiment to determine its shape would be the most scientific.  
  
Interestingly, there was a rumour a while back that the Earth was wider than officially claimed, but that is all it was.  
  
Good try though.  
  
Anything else?  
  
Edit: I decided to dig a little deeper into the Rutan Voyager and came across two interesting bits of information. According to the book “Voyager’s Amazing Journey” by Steve Osborn, from Signposts. Copyright © 1989 by Holt, Rinehart and Winston, the plane flew 25012 miles which is 40252.9km. The Earth’s circumference is according to google 40075km giving us a difference of 175.9km.  
  
The flight path of the plane was a strong wavy line from the air force base to the equator then below the equator over the Atlantic, then back to the base again. So they went from 34.9 N latitude to what looks to be about -5 S latitude and back again all in a wavy line (often a very steep wavy line) 3km above the Earth and they only went 175.9km further than the calculated circumference of the Earth at the equator at sea level! Incredible. This is only loosely indicative of a concave Earth. We need real data as I’ve already mentioned before.

Saros, are you switching now from flat earth to bowl flat earth to wavy flat earth to convex earth to concave Earth? You ol’ trickster you.  
Someone has already had a go at diamond Earth, how about pentagram shaped Earth? That hasn’t been taken yet.

Fake or not, I would expect it to fly more than the average circumference of the earth plus it’s altitude due to not flying a perfect circumnavigation by having to adjust for winds and suchlike. Likewise that would also explain why it could notch up that distance in an concave model.

What happened to my post about the lunar eclipses? I also included in there the links about Rutan Voyager that I see you have used. I am not switching to any model. What I demand is to not have a model unless we’re sure it is correct. We should remain at the investigation stage instead of jumping to preliminary conclusions – flat, concave, diamond, blah blah, not to mention that whatever we might ‘discover’ will never be taken seriously by anyone, and it won’t change a thing. Better save the energy for some real experiment which can really prove stuff.

So, you knew about the extremely wavy flight path and the 34.9N to -5S route with only 175.9km difference and you still thought this was proof of a convex Earth?

You don’t demand anything. You are free to think what you like. I’ve already presented two experiments that can only show the Earth to be concave with the convex and flat scenario out the window because of these two experiments (and also international southern hemisphere flight times prove flat earth wrong). If you are still trying to keep options open after all this then I can only conclude that was your agenda all along. Pretending to be a flat earther then a convex earther was an interesting but revealing tactic.

Some of the arguments for a flat earth fall short for me, such as having to guard a 25,000 mile perimeter so no one can see the edge, evidence of circumnavigation, no historical evidence of an edge, the poor excuses given that we would be able to the angular incline of distant objects such as planes and hot air balloons due to the curve when if even 20 miles away this as this would only mean a fraction of a degree in incline which would not be noticeable. The rotating stars difference from the northern to southern hemisphere alone shows that the earth is either concave or convex with either a rotating sky or a rotating earth and the evidence against the latter is strong.

Indeed Andrew. I see you have researched flat earth theory more than I have. I stopped most other research once I checked the flight times.  
  
I am personally convinced Saros was counterintelligence trying to muddy the waters by attempting to keep all options open. I read a while ago that that is their way of operating so that no-one knows what the real truth is.

Quite. That is even a simpler way of putting it; one which I had forgotten due to my current research.

How do you think the clouds are causing this effect? And how do they do that so that if you extend the sun rays upwards that they all seem to meet in one spot, especially given this really wide angle downwards? Just curious.  
  
I still think that by pictures like these (we all know them from self experience) one could actually determine the height of the sun’s orbit (sth around 100 km seems ok to me).

To be fair to Saros, he questions the flat earther, cikljamas to extremes too on this forum http://www.energeticforum.com/renewable-energy/17050-north-south-4.html Though  
cikljamas makes some good points generally against the Heliocentric model he still makes some schoolboy errors in support of his flat earth model by appealing to jets over water (not a problem for either convex or concave models in a horizontal flight) and flight times with stopovers in post 92 as this is easily disputed by actual stopover times, non direct flights or comparing general flight times with stopovers generally based on his flat earth map for even shorter or similar distances and takes no account of the reality of flight schedules (in his second video on that post. For example Sydney to São Paulo in South America can be done in 21:20 with a stopover which is a similar distance. see https://www.google.co.uk/flights/

Saros is very busy isn’t he? Pretending to be a flat earther one minute and then saying anything is possible, then pretending to be a convexer, then throwing names and insults around (textbook shill 101), then saying anything is possible. Either he has a severe case of multiple personality disorder with a lot of (day)time on his hands or he is contel and I am going with the latter.

Hints in language and culture for the concave earth  
  
Lots of expressions known to us for a very long time make much more sense with the knowledge of the concave earth. LSC already mentioned “mother earth”, being a symbol of the uterus, where each and everyone of us was born from. (In german, the term is “Gebarmutter”, mutter meaning “mother” btw) But there are more.  
  
E.g., the word “extra-terrestrial” (=outside being) makes much more sense when we are living IN the earth, not on the earth).  
  
Probably the greatest game changer would be astro-theology. It is hard to grasp that the heavens should have any effect on our lives if we lived on a tiny ball in a vast universe beyond imagination, looking at randomly seeming “constellations” that are billions and billions of kilometers away. If the heavens are _inside_ the earth, they definitely are at the center of all things. No wonder you want to know, what they are all about.

In reply to Icecoldsun.  
Yeah. Astrology makes a lot more sense in a concave Earth as it means space and everything that resides in it and is influenced by it has a rhythm.  
Astrology funnily enough is completely 100% geocentric, (I think a couple of astrologers have attempted to try a helio version).  
  
Makes perfect sense now.  
  
At the moment I’m loving John Keel’s “superspectrum” idea. (The Eighth Tower). Fits in perfectly with a concave Earth too as do all things paranormal. Out of interest I think each superspectrum is separated by right angles but that subject is for another day far in the future.

In reply to Wild Heretic.  
Indeed, anything is not possible and there is a difference between asking honest questions and attacking from all sides and expecting to be enlightened from such a worldview. My own interest in this comes from perhaps even only half conscience anomalies i have experienced myself at the coast with the fact that the horizon always stays at eye level no matter how high you go which should not be possible with a flat earth or a convex one and that my binoculars have bought into focus things things that were half below it such as ships. One can always question the testimony of scientific experiments which are not empirical evidence to anyone else unless they can be performed oneself or are self evident to us, but this i have seen for myself. That is not say testimony of scientific experiments are always false of course but TPTB do pick and chose what they wish to represent. The fallacies of science usually rely on false base assumptions, theories, induction and affirming the consequent as well as political psy-ops, social engineering and paradigms of course. IMO modern science stifles true research and truth by rigidly sticking to a paradigm for political and social engineering purposes such as the Heliocentric model which would need the absurd theories of Cosmic Evolution and a Big Bang to be true and that would always have to deny actual reality and intelligent design at any cost.

In reply to Andrew.  
Yeah, I have my own theories on why the giant cosmos/evolution/modern psychology, random speck of dust/life has been pushed to oblivion.  
  
One of them is that if Robert Monroe is right and the Earth is a farm, then not knowing it is a farm and acting as if we are all alone and only our physical bodies may produce a better emotional (end)product from the livestock. They could have tried different organisms and “worldviews” over the centuries and millennia to tweak the juice to see which has the highest quality. Or perhaps it is juice wars and different farmers demand different types of juice or want the juice directed to them only to get the most out if it (hence worship). Just a few ideas.  
  
Another idea on this line of thought is that we don’t have any real major violent clashes anymore (big wars) as we now have mass sports events, cinema and tv to emotionally involve us to the same extent, perhaps this is why there is/was a push towards illusion and virtual reality. The juice may or may not be quite as good, but you have it every night and above all, you can tweak the virtual reality a lot easier than actual reality to get the desired product.  
  
Of course, it’s not that being a “victim” of juice extraction is bad. We enjoy the ups and downs of a sports event etc. Maybe though its time to take control of our own juice and use it ourselves? How, I’m not sure. Assuming this theory is valid. If we do, then we can expect a visit from the farmers me thinks!  
  
Another idea. Blood sacrifice is no longer needed of humans as slaughterhouses now do that on an industrial scale. Gosh, this farm theory is starting to fit a bit too well.

Obviously mine and your worldview may differ to as to the whys of such deceptions but at least we can agree on the probable evidence of a concave earth and against such paradigms of modern pseudo science . Personally i find Monroe or David Icke and any new age or pagan writings cannot produce a self authenticating view that can even compared to the bible which does explain creation and our position in it Even the UN have adopted the new age, Mother Earth and anti Christian paradigm. Google the UN and the new age, based upon the theosophical Luciferian teachings of the the Lucis Trust that most so called “truth sites” adopt. Deception is all around us, but what do the clowns offer instead, Oh the new age and more deception of course.

Yes, I agree on the New age as being disinfo (lies mixed with a bit of truth), especially the channeling lark. That Barbara whatshername and the “Pleiadians” start off with the heliocentric model! Haha. oops.  
  
As you say, David Icke isn’t productive and is more like shock doctrine; and very Lucis.  
  
I like Munroe but I think the perspective is limiting. The farm theory is just one of many possible reasons though. Having access to aether technology is a big one IMO and probably overlaps farm theory if correct. The word “containment” springs to mind. I do believe the deception is ultimately beyond human (at least Earth human), however after that it is speculation for me.  
  
I’m on the fence with Christianity. I had a pretty negative view of it overall, but recently experienced something of an emotional Zoroastrian moment, so I would need to work things through thoroughly before coming to any conclusions as to my opinion on that front.  
  
Yes. We can agree that the name of the game is deception, but I have a lot more dots to connect before I can see the multi-faceted mesh of the big picture more clearly (and that is non-David Icke dots as well) 🙂  
  
One area of future research would definitely be the “underworld” and other “dimensions” aka the superspectrum. My own feeling is that this area is very important.

Not sure about that. The second photo 10cm above the water slopes slightly down in a straight line to just before the “Bascule” bit and then does the same at this juncture at a slightly more acute angle. I am not sure what is causing that effect. Is it the waterline or water itself (waves)? Camera?  
  
The effect is caused by something, but it obviously isn’t the geometric shape of the Earth unless the Earth is polygonal. 🙂 Also, the horizon at 10cm high shouldn’t show any curvature anyway no matter the Earth’s shape.

Thank you for your open and honest reply WH, I really appreciate the work you have done and look forward to your next article. You do have the honesty to separate your thoughts on Metaphysics to the real evidence of a concave Earth and admit it, unlike the new age Gurus. It’s not really a problem for my beliefs and worldview to accept a concave world as it would not clash with my metaphysical beliefs, but as you have pointed out, much of the new age and it’s Guru’s relies on deceiving us into Heliocentric Space and all the baggage and media fakery that brings.
