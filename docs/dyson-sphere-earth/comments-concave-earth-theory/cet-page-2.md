Hey… I think that these trails of stars are the best evidences of earth as concave. It’s my speculation but… examine yourself.  
  
If the universe is as big, as they say – Alpha Centauri s is 4 light years away, from nearly all points of Earth, when we will look vertically up on stars, we should see them on film as straight and parallel lines.  
  
Exception would be North and South Poles, where we would notice circles.  
  
Just take a look at this link.  
  
https://www.google.com.au/search?q=movement+of+the+southern+cross&client=firefox-a&hs=rLj&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=v-NsUoiYHqjQiAf3uIAg&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&biw=1432&bih=787#q=star+movement+polaris&rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&tbm=isch&imgdii=_  
  
All pictures are showing us circles or part of the circle.  
  
No one picture with straight parallel lines.  
  
And that is absolutely impossible! Curved lines are 100% proof of Earth being o concave.  
  
Tell us what you think! 🙂

I think the idea that the stars move in circles around a fixed point above the poles is that it is the Earth rotating which causes this effect.  
  
However, the stars revolve 4 minutes too fast each day (I am not sure if this is a constant or depends on the time of year… something to research perhaps). This means that after 365 days, the Earth has revolved 1460 minutes quicker than it should have, which is 24 hours and 20 minutes too fast per year. This means that the Earth should lose 1 day per year, but it does not. It actually gains nearly 6 hours every year and this is the reason we have leap years!  
  
Go figure.

Ooh yeah! Another observation concerning basic RADAR systems is ‘vertical beam width’.  
  
It seems that at least the ‘Raymarine’ range (as previously linked) rotates a stream of electromagnetic radiation within a fan of 25 degrees to the vertical and only 1.85 degrees to the horizontal. Why would they need to do this? I assume that the best part of this large, vertical angle is going to be looking up, not down into the sea.  
  
Is ‘RADAR’ utilizing the ‘skywave’ effect off the ionosphere?…No, can’t be. Ionosphere is reckoned to begin at +/- 100Km altitude.  
  
Presumptuous perhaps, but is not RADAR and its horizon busting properties (without the aid of the ionosphere) further proof that the inhabitable area of Earth simply curves the other way to what we have all been told?

Scud, the link didn’t show. Can you try and post it again?  
  
It’s a bit late tonight, but I’ll definitely look into this tomorrow.  
  
Sounds very promising.  
  
I’ve had a sneaky look just now and you could really be on to something here Scud.  
  
The range of this radar is 48 nautical miles. Such a distance is far too short to bounce off the ionosphere like radio waves – Skywaves.  
  
http://www.raymarine.com/view/?id=312  
  
And that is the limit of its range. Let’s find out tomorrow what its MINIMUM range is!  
  
It’s too late now for me to look at this further.

A re-wording. See if it works….  
  
Standard issue maritime RADAR systems of the type that you’ll see fitted to every sailing sloop / gin palace worth its salt have stated ranges of anything up to 120 nautical miles.  
  
This particular model http://www.raymarine.co.uk/view/?id=174 has a quoted range of 72nm but as appears typical, there is no corresponding information as to the height that it should be installed to achieve its potential. Not surprising, because if we stuff this info through… http://www.ringbell.co.uk/info/hdist.htm we find that in order to peer over the horizon at floating objects this distant your yacht would need a mast 3,500 feet tall!  
  
Am I missing a simple trick here?

Hmm…seems the same for lighthouses.  
  
http://www.bigsiteofamazingfacts.com/where-is-the-worlds-most-powerful-lighthouse  
  
“But the lights that can be seen from the greatest distance are the bulbs on top of the Empire State Building in New York City. Each of these bulbs has the power of 450 million candles, and can be seen from the ground from as far away as 80 miles . . . and from an airplane from as far away as 300 miles!”  
  
Again, if this information is correct it shouldn’t be possible as our calculator says that from the very top of the Empire State’s spire (1250 feet) a light could only remain visible out to 43.3 miles…if Earth is indeed a planet of course!

Hi there,  
I have already posted under “Disappearing Stars” but will post here too as these comments seem to be more active.  
Please, TotalRecall, take up Ab on his invitation and do an interview on the Fakeologist. I would love to hear more of your views. This information has to get out to more people.

Ok, seems the ‘trick’ that I’m missing is that radio signals in this particular band-width and even visible light to a certain degree are supposedly recognised to ‘bounce’ or ‘skip’ between Earth and atmosphere (no specific region) allowing a ‘below horizon’ (that’s Earth’s convex curvature to you and me) range capability.  
It’s described here.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwave  
  
Anyone buy this explanation? I don’t, simply because it makes no sense whatsoever. A neutrally charged gas (air below Ionosphere) has light bending properties in direct relation to the solid / liquid beneath? Really?

In reply to Scud.  
I don’t buy it either.  
  
Wiki says – “Ground waves refer to the propagation of radio waves parallel to and adjacent to the surface of the Earth, following the curvature of the Earth.”  
  
This means that the waves travel in the air, not the ground.  
  
and  
  
“Conductivity of the surface affects the propagation of ground waves, with more conductive surfaces such as water providing better propagation.”  
  
How does the conductivity of the ground affect waves traveling in the air? As you say, the air is neutral and not ionic.  
  
But it is not just that. You mentioned that the marine radar is placed on top of the mast and radiates the wave just above the horizontal and 25 degree next to the vertical – so basically it radiates up, not down or even level. These waves aren’t traveling parallel or adjacent to the ground at all.  
  
It seems these radar devices operate similar to the military infra-red camera in a concave Earth, by pointing up, with the near horizontal angle detecting near objects and the 25 degree vertical picking up the long range boats 120 NM away.  
  
I would imagine the reason why the waves have a greater range over water is because water is relatively “flat” with no opposing objects like mountains and buildings to dissipate the waves earlier than they should.  
  
So yet again, it seems the truth is the exact opposite of what we are told. Wiki says that the lower the frequency, the more the waves travel with the curvature of the Earth, when really it is the opposite in the concave Earth model – It is visible light (and possibly all the higher frequencies) which followed the curvature of the Earth, probably because of gravity, which opens up a whole new can of worms and questions regarding frequency and gravity. Does gravity have a frequency etc. which is a another topic. However, since visible light is one of our 5 senses, then it logically follows that our other 4 senses may also be affected by gravity. If so, and if gravity has a frequency with which our 5 senses resonate, then maybe this “physical” reality is nothing more than us being subjected to and tuned to the greater body which is the Earth cavity. I’ll talk about this a lot more in the next article.  
  
Instead in the concave Earth model, it is the lower the frequency of light, the less it is affected by gravity. This would also tie in with those people who claim that UFOs are visible in the infrared, not visible light. (Assuming they are “anti-gravity” vehicles) this might be because their anti-gravity systems “bend” visible light making them either falsely positioned or completely invisible – or for complete full spectrum invisibility, using Steve’s disappearing stars explanation, maybe they are concentrating the aether more on one side (for propulsion pressure purposes) and so light is unable to transmit on the other sides as there is no aether for the waves to travel in?  
  
A bit off topic, but thought I’d mention it.

How they create those blue marble photo’s of earth?  
“..They map them onto a 3D sphere..” That’s right, they don’t map them onto the inside of a concave bowl.  
  
We know they stitch allot of 100km altitude pictures together to make it appear as if it is one picture from a far greater distance. This kind of articles are all dots or pieces of the puzzle. It’s getting easier by the day to connect them all.

Will do some infrared photographic field research with long lens, long distance horizon, when the weather gets better. Infrared photography clears the haze. To be continued.

Just a hint but… all is possible. On one forum in Poland I’ve read an opinion about Copernicus. I could not get the guy to confirm that news because he just vanished from that forum.  
  
He said that he was reading REAL works of Copernicus and he wrote about Earth being concave. When church authorities found about it, he was imprisoned in Frombork castle until he died.  
  
Apparently his work was smuggled somehow outside the castle and he APPARENTLY the poster saw it in… Russia.  
  
Maybe just a gossip, but knowing how the system works – Cyrus Teed and others knew a lot about it and the story about Copernicus could be right.  
  
I could not find any info about the real findings of Copernicus. But knowledge about such hint can help us – sooner or later.  
  
Kind regards…

The author fails to understand the simple concept of the fact that the horizon REMAINS at eye level at extreme altitudes, in which a theoretical escapade over a convex “planet” would produce a lower than eye level horizon, and neglects the probable cause of any such apparent eyewitness convexity at high altitudes is being distorted through a window adding to the barrel distortion, especially the front of an airplane, where the peripheral angle is greater and where the window is arched toward the viewer. The side windows, where periphery is limited may also produce the barrel distortion if the plane is tilted laterally as well. Pathetic presuppositional error here.

In reply to JohnyBravo.  
Johny,  
  
It’s fantastic that you are going to experiment with infrared photography. I remember years ago reading that there were something like three types of infra-red cameras; each one detecting infrared in a different band. I think (memory a bit sketchy here) the band that contained the lowest wavelength was only allowed for the military (Surprise surprise!)  
  
I think I found what I read.  
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_looking_infrared  
  
It seems though that this wavelength can’t see far because it is the “heat” wavelength which is absorbed by water vapour etc. Maybe the medium wavelength is the better one. Although:  
  
“…these camera systems can see through smoke, fog, haze, and other atmospheric obscurants better than a visible light camera can”  
  
And the three types of camera are described here:  
  
http://www.facilitiesnet.com/equipmentrentaltools/article/Understanding-the-Three-Types-of-Infrared-Cameras–10652#  
  
Which contradicts wiki (at least at first read) by saying:  
  
“Long-wavelength cameras — the most popular infrared camera — typically detect infrared wavelengths in the range of 7-12 microns. Cameras operating in this spectral range provide great deal of detail because atmospheric absorption is minimal.”  
  
Mmmmm.

Now that is interesting.  
  
Scud has researched more about the Jesuits and their involvement with this heliocentric model than I have.  
  
My initial take is that the Jesuits sole purpose is to keep man ignorant. Why? Not sure. Control mostly I suppose… but perhaps not realizing that this world isn’t as “natural” as we would imagine could make the reasons for us being here less effective so to speak.  
  
Free-range cows produce better milk than ones trapped in a barn 24/7. Perhaps this is the real reason.  
  
Bizarrely, there may be a positive reason behind this. If man thinks he is alone in a vast “Godless” universe, then all decisions man makes have their own consequences and so maybe make him more responsible and “grown-up”. If he thinks the Earth is flat and “God” looks after him, he could remain an eternal child.  
  
But screw that pseudo-philosophical reasoning. Let’s blow the lid wide open anyway. It all boils down to containment and “milking” at the end of the day I reckon. The truth and being responsible are hardly incompatible anyway.

I was looking for information in Russian regarding Concave Earth, and I found an old article from June, 1981 published in a magazine called “Science and Life”.

Incredible timing. You see the Sunlight paths inside the Earth on the diagram. That is the same as the paths I have deduced but kind of in reverse and more detailed. I will eventually (a couple of months maybe) publish this in the next article. The sun light path opens up a whole new area of research with regards the aether and magnetism and gravity etc.  
  
I’ll look into that horizon theory. It is similar to the Dutch one I found and posted somewhere in the comments section below. The obvious problem with it is that boat would only disappear under the horizon at a very specific time of day and direction. That is not to say it is wrong as I haven’t looked into and tested the theory that something disappears below the horizon “bottom-first” only at a specific time.  
  
Good find.  
  
EDIT: Last night I was in the middle of working through something when I saw your post and the Russian picture. Having now worked through it, it turns out the bendy light of the Russian picture is exactly the same as my own deductions. Doesn’t mean it is right, but at least I’m not alone.

Hey WH, et al. this is my idea of what’s going on with the horizon. I believe there is a Horizontal Crease that’s created…  
  
http://www.missteribabylonestar.com/wpimages/wp1295a190_06.png  
  
The Leveler Experiments conducted by Heinrich Hohenner (1874-1966) proved that light bends upwards when it strikes the earth (contrary what is taught in optics). Wilhel Martin re-conducted this experiment in 2001 and reached the same conclusion.  
  
For the observer’s viewpoint, as he looks across the land, his eye reaches the “verge”, which is always at eye level regardless of his altitude. Behind the verge is a blind spot that is concluded by the celestial orbs rising and setting in the distance. The glass sky creates an optical inversion to the heavens by refraction. This creates a Horizonal “crease” that lies below the actual visual horizon of the celestial orbs. Thus there are actual two “horizons”, the initial one created by the verge, and the latter one seen past the verge on the celestial sphere. This Horizonal Crease however, is sometimes visible in the extreme polar regions in the case of superior mirages or fata morganas.

He was an inverted hollow earther but he thought the earth rotates around a stationary sphere of fixed stars, while the sun performs an elliptical orbit.

Hi ~  
When I was reading through All of Your Fantastic Information, etc., I noticed something about Sand that maybe You don’t know of – when an Electrical Lighten Strike, from the Sky, comes down and specifically strikes Sand – it Becomes Glass! I have Seen that with My own Eyes >  
I’ve heard and read that the Oceans, with Time, can mold Sand into Glass – I have seen Glass formations at the Beach, but I really don’t know if that is a Fact. I have found glass rock formations near Volcano’s so, that is another Theory…?

Thanks for the link Carole. I think I might know what the stars are now. I’ll write about it in the next article, but the basic premise is that they must be connected to the sun (I’ll explain later) and I think it may have to do with its curved light. I’ll have to give it more thought.

Fawn,  
  
Are you saying that the glass in the sky could have been formed by lightning strikes? For that to happen, there would have to be a lot of sand in a certain position in orbit 100 km above us. Seems highly improbable to me. Firstly, the sand would very likely fall back down to Earth due to gravity. Secondly, where does this sand originate from and how did it get in this exact position? Thirdly, the glass is a necessary component for the Sun to be a light-bulb which denotes engineering.  
  
The glass in the sky article has a picture of glass formed by lightning and it looks tubular and stoney (fulgerites).

In reply to Enlighten Fawn.  
The glass forming from lightning strikes is ruled out from the explanation of why either tektites or Libyan Desert Glass form, mainly due to the extraterrestrial elements found in them, namely iridium and osmium, which are not found anywhere in the terrestrial sand. My theory does propose, however, that sand did once descend from the upper celestial sphere/ocean at the time of the global deluge. It dropped to ionospheric levels (100km) and levitated and began to fuse together as the ionized particles began to melt together.

Steve, I have also deduced a tetrahedron in the middle of the earth space; however, it needn’t be solid (and probably isn’t), but rather it is the base of the core direction of the path of light of the sun. It’s lines are curved, continue to form another shape and the top and bottom points are pointing at the equator, rather than at the poles. I also know what causes this tetrahedron effect.  
  
I woke up this morning with one hell of a wild speculation involving this. I’ll post it soonish but this part is purely speculative with no evidence behind it. Because of this I have a loose explanation for the aether (with no proof). I think the aether is just the “greater light”. It also seems that the separate “worlds” are separated by a 90 degree angle… speculative only.

another point to consider with the tetrahedron, is that a double tetrahedron inverted upon itself creates the mercaba, or the “chariot”, however the negative space this creates in the center is the octahedron, and of course the spinning mercaba is said to produce energy. check it out…

Steve, I meant Octahedron, not tetra. That’s my mistake in the labeling lol.  
  
It’s the same shape you have – the double-ended four sided pyramid. The only difference is that the sides are curved.  
  
I’ll explain it in my next article in my step-by-step logic. I’m literally writing it now. I could explain it in a sentence, but it wouldn’t be understood unless I showed how I came to that conclusion if you know what I mean. A bit like the answer to an equation I suppose. The answer is 42! lol (kidding).  
  
This is the shape I mean:

Interesting copy…”Our core heart is found in the octahedron as an expression of self-love and compassion. Prayer is invoked in the form of the icosahedron. The twelve faces of ‘God within’ are discovered in the dodecahedron.  
The star tetrahedron is a wonderful metaphor for us to work with and understand. It is two tetrahedrons joining and becoming one. One of the tetrahedrons represents heaven and is moving downward while the other tetrahedron represents earth and is moving upward. As they become one the star tetrahedron is formed with an octahedron internally present. The octahedron is the symbol for our heart. Thus, the metaphor is: “Heaven and earth join to form heart.””  
  
http://www.jimalbani.com/ArticlesSG.asp  
  
So, the heaven tetra and earth tetra form the heart of the heaven and earth, in the form of the octahedron. Works out really neat!

Hi WH ~  
  
Thank You for Your reply > The progressive Science, to this degree, I Am not in tune with, yet :-}  
I Am just remarking on personal facts that I have experienced – I Know that Jesus Christ Superstar* did state: “Anything Is Possible” :-}  
  
I do Know that the Bible has Genius in it, but I also Know that it has been altered towards society’s death culture, etc.  
I’ve done a solid 14 year research on Jesus Christ’s Words, and Many were not even published in the Bible. Many of HIS Words have been manipulated, etc. What My Main Focus is to let people know that Jesus was murdered by the evil entities because ‘they’ know that We (Human Beings & Godly Wildlife) Have Been Granted Forever Life, in the Physical! Live Like Forever & Truth Will Endeavor ~ Earth Is Heaven+  
  
Anyway, I was Wondering if You think Meteor Impacts Create Glass?  
  
Merry Christmas and an Exciting New Year*  
( I Know Time Is Selective, but ‘these’ traditions that are in Love, I accept:)  
Fawn ~

ok, this star streak analysis that Mariusz asked me to animate show be the nail in the coffin to the convex world. I guess it’s all a matter of dissemination.  
The star streaks “should” be vertical if we truly were on a convex ball.

I took it down because I am not convinced about it yet. Mariusz, I don’t think is either. Eh well.

Hi, I wonder how would you explain polar day and polar night lasting up tp 6 months at the poles?

That’s an easy one David. It’s in the next article, but basically it is the Sun that tilts at 23.4 degrees at both solstices. I’ll explain the exact mechanism as to why this occurs too (which is a lot more than can be said of current astronomers as to why the earth tilts at said angle). Gravity is also exactly explained by the same mechanism and leads to further insights on frequencies and the possible microcosm (the latter mechanism won’t be new to alternative science theorists though if they read it).

Many thanks for your exemplary efforts over 2013 and look forward to more stunning ‘revelations’ this coming year, which I hope will not include giant hailstones..

Thanks Scud. Merry Christmas to you and your family too.  
  
I definitely have one more card up my sleeve, but after that it’s in the lap of the Gods.  
  
I may look at the underworld and the origins of man, or look at the microcosm, or do something a touch more practical; or sweet F.A. 😉  
  
Steve is very industrious though and I am sure we will continue to see a steady stream of material from him.
